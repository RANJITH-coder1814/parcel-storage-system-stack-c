# parcel-storage-system-stack-c
A stack-based parcel storage management system implemented in C using array-based stack operations.

📦 Parcel Storage System Using Stack (C)

A menu-driven Parcel Storage Management System implemented using Stack data structure in C. This project simulates real-world parcel handling, where parcels are added and removed using LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle.

📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how stack operations can be applied to build a simple storage management system.
It supports:

Adding parcels

Removing parcels

Viewing stored parcels

Checking storage status

This project is ideal for:

Learning Stack data structure
